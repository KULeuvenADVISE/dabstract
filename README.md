# dabstract
DAtaset and preprocessing ABSTRACTion library

This is a -lightweight- library for defining and processing data(sets). The goals of the library are to a) uniformize dataset classes, b) speed up experiments where the data does not fit into memory, c) offer a general way of processing data independent of the data source, d) seamlessly combine different datasets.

A full documentation will be made available soon. Till then, one can check the examples/introduction folder for the readme1/2/3_*.py scripts. 

This repo will also serve as a container for all ISAAC related datasets and ADVISE datasets (public and private branch).
