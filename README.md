# dabstract
DAtaset and preprocessing ABSTRACTion library

This is a -lightweight- library for defining and processing data(sets). The goals of the library are to a) uniformize dataset classes, b) speed up experiments where the data does not fit into memory, c) offer a general way of processing data independent of the data source, d) seamlessly combine different datasets.

A full documentation will be made available soon. Till then, one can check the examples/introduction folder for the readme1/2/3_*.py scripts. 

This repo will also serve as a container for all ISAAC related datasets and ADVISE datasets (public and private branch).

## Install instructions
1) clone to a folder of choice (should be easily accessible, e.g. among other utilities)
2) go to folder in terminal
3) "pip install --editable ."

The --editable flag makes sure that the package uses the files you used for installing as source, such that you can adjust and push updates to this repository when you have a new feature or for a bug fix.
